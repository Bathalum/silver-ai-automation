## Conclusion

The codebase demonstrates strong alignment with the Feature Requirement Document in core areas like architecture, UI design, and basic functionality. The main gaps are in advanced features like workflow execution, AI agent UI components, and real vector search implementation. 

The foundation is solid and the existing patterns provide a good base for implementing the missing features. The priority should be on completing the workflow execution engine and AI agent integration, as these are core differentiators for the platform.

The implementation follows clean architecture principles well and maintains good separation of concerns, making it relatively straightforward to add the missing features without major refactoring.
