## Architecture Compliance

### Clean Architecture Principles Enforced

1. **Dependency Inversion**: Service depends on abstractions (use cases and interfaces), not concretions
2. **Layer Separation**: Clear boundaries between Application Service, Use Cases, and Domain Services
3. **Data Transformation**: Returns DTOs, not domain entities, maintaining layer boundaries
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each method has a single, well-defined purpose
5. **Interface Segregation**: Clean separation of concerns with focused interfaces

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Compliance

1. **Tests as Specifications**: Integration tests serve as executable specifications for the service
2. **Boundary Filters**: Tests enforce architectural compliance and prevent boundary violations
3. **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive coverage prevents functionality regression
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation for service capabilities
