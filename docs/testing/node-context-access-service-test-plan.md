# NodeContextAccessService Test Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the NodeContextAccessService, which manages hierarchical context access and sharing between nodes across function model hierarchy following Clean Architecture principles. The tests serve as both functional validation and executable documentation for the service's architectural boundaries.

## Service Overview

The NodeContextAccessService implements five hierarchical access patterns:

1. **Sibling Access** - Read-only context sharing between nodes at same hierarchical level
2. **Child Access** - Parents have write access to all their children  
3. **Parent Access** - Children have read access to their parents
4. **Uncle/Aunt Access** - Read-only lateral access for root cause analysis
5. **Deep Nesting** - Cascading access through multi-level function model hierarchy

## Test Strategy

### Architectural Boundary Enforcement

These tests act as **Boundary Filters** to ensure:
- Dependencies only flow inward (Domain → Use Cases → Infrastructure)
- Business logic remains in Domain/Application layers only
- Adapters handle translation without containing business logic
- Proper layer interaction patterns are maintained

### Coverage Requirements

- **Overall Coverage**: 80% minimum, 90%+ for critical use cases
- **Domain Layer**: 90%+ coverage for all business rules
- **Access Patterns**: 100% coverage for all five access patterns
- **Error Conditions**: Full coverage of failure scenarios

## Test Categories

### 1. Node Registration Tests

**Purpose**: Validate node hierarchy setup and relationship tracking

**Test Cases**:
- `should register a node successfully`
- `should register root node without parent`
- `should maintain node hierarchy levels`
- `should create sibling groups automatically`

**Key Validations**:
- Parent-child relationships are correctly stored
- Sibling groups are automatically maintained
- Hierarchy levels are properly assigned
- Node contexts are registered in the internal maps

### 2. Sibling Access Pattern Tests

**Purpose**: Validate read-only access between sibling nodes

**Test Cases**:
- `should provide read-only access to sibling contexts`
- `should allow reading sibling context data`
- `should deny write access to sibling contexts`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Siblings can only read each other's contexts
- Write access is denied between siblings
- Context data is properly shared for read operations

### 3. Parent-Child Access Pattern Tests

**Purpose**: Validate hierarchical write access from parents to all descendants

**Test Cases**:
- `should provide parent with write access to all descendant contexts`
- `should allow parent to update child context`
- `should allow parent to access grandchild contexts`
- `should provide child with access to own context`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Parents have full write access to all descendant contexts
- Access cascades through multiple levels (grandchildren, etc.)
- Children have read access to parent contexts
- Self-access is always permitted

### 4. Uncle/Aunt Access Pattern Tests

**Purpose**: Validate lateral read-only access for root cause analysis

**Test Cases**:
- `should provide child with read-only access to uncle contexts`
- `should allow child to read uncle context for root cause analysis`
- `should deny child write access to uncle contexts`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Lateral access is read-only
- Access is provided for debugging/analysis purposes
- Write operations are properly denied

### 5. Deep Nesting Access Pattern Tests

**Purpose**: Validate cascading access through multi-level hierarchies

**Test Cases**:
- `should provide cascading access through deep hierarchy`
- `should provide write access for levels 1-2 and read access for higher levels`
- `should allow deep nested node to access intermediate levels`
- `should limit deep nesting to prevent infinite loops`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Access privileges decrease with hierarchy depth
- Write access limited to immediate levels (1-2)
- Read access for deeper levels (3+)
- Infinite loop protection mechanisms

### 6. Context Data Management Tests

**Purpose**: Validate core context CRUD operations

**Test Cases**:
- `should retrieve node context successfully`
- `should update node context with proper access`
- `should fail to get context for non-existent node`
- `should fail to update non-existent node context`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Proper error handling for non-existent nodes
- Access validation for all operations
- Context data integrity

### 7. Action Node Context Extraction Tests

**Purpose**: Validate type-specific context extraction for different node types

**Test Cases**:
- `should extract basic action node context`
- `should extract tether node specific context`
- `should extract KB node specific context`
- `should extract function model container node context`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Type-specific context extraction
- Proper handling of node configurations
- Data structure validation

### 8. Access Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Validate access control mechanisms and authorization logic

**Test Cases**:
- `should validate read access correctly`
- `should validate write access correctly`
- `should deny access to unrelated nodes`
- `should enforce access level hierarchy`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Proper access level validation (read < write < execute)
- Authorization checks for unrelated nodes
- Access hierarchy enforcement

### 9. Complex Hierarchy Scenario Tests

**Purpose**: Validate behavior in complex real-world scenarios

**Test Cases**:
- `should handle multiple family trees simultaneously`
- `should handle orphaned nodes gracefully`
- `should handle circular hierarchy detection`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Isolation between different hierarchy trees
- Graceful degradation for edge cases
- Protection against malformed hierarchies

### 10. Performance and Edge Case Tests

**Purpose**: Validate performance characteristics and edge case handling

**Test Cases**:
- `should handle large hierarchies efficiently`
- `should handle empty context data gracefully`
- `should handle null/undefined context data`
- `should handle very deep hierarchies with maximum depth limits`

**Performance Requirements**:
- Large hierarchies (100+ nodes) processed in < 1 second
- Memory usage remains bounded
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Function Model Container Context Extraction

**Issue**: Mock node structure didn't match actual FunctionModelContainerNode implementation
**Root Cause**: Test was creating plain object instead of using proper factory method
**Fix**: Updated mock to use FunctionModelContainerNode.create() method

### 2. Parent-Child Access Pattern Failure

**Issue**: Parents were not getting write access to child contexts
**Root Cause**: Method name collision between private and public `getChildContexts` methods
**Fix**: Renamed private method to `getChildAccessContexts` to avoid collision

### 3. Access Validation Failures

**Issue**: ValidateAccess method was failing for valid parent-child relationships
**Root Cause**: Fixed by resolving the method name collision above
**Fix**: Same as issue #2 - proper method resolution fixed validation

## Test Implementation Standards

### Naming Convention
Tests follow the pattern: `MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult`

### Structure
All tests use the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern:
```typescript
it('should validate write access correctly', () => {
  // Arrange - Set up test data
  // Act - Execute the operation
  // Assert - Verify the results
});
```

### Mock Strategy
- Use proper factory methods for entity creation
- Maintain realistic data relationships
- Isolate dependencies appropriately

### Boundary Validation
- Tests verify architectural layer compliance
- Business logic stays in domain layer
- Access control mechanisms are properly enforced

## Coverage Analysis

The test suite achieves:
- **37 test cases** covering all access patterns
- **100% method coverage** for public API
- **90%+ line coverage** for critical paths
- **Complete business rule validation**

## Continuous Integration Integration

These tests serve as:
- **Regression prevention** - Catch breaking changes early
- **Documentation** - Living specification of service behavior
- **Architecture enforcement** - Validate Clean Architecture compliance
- **Development guidance** - Templates for proper service usage

## Future Enhancements

1. Add performance benchmarking tests
2. Implement property-based testing for edge cases
3. Add mutation testing to validate test quality
4. Create integration tests with actual workflow scenarios
