# Phase 1: Repository Infrastructure TDD Implementation Plan

## Overview

## Test Execution Instructions

### Running Individual Repository Tests
```bash
# Enhanced Function Model Repository
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/enhanced-supabase-function-model-repository.test.ts

# Node Repository  
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/supabase-node-repository.test.ts

# Node Link Repository
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/supabase-node-link-repository.test.ts

# AI Agent Repository
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/supabase-ai-agent-repository.test.ts

# Audit Log Repository
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/supabase-audit-log-repository.test.ts
```

### Running All Repository Tests
```bash
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/
```

## Expected Test Results

### Current State (All Tests Should Fail)
- **Total Failing Tests**: ~400+ tests across all repositories
- **Expected Behavior**: All tests throw "Not implemented yet - TDD failing test" errors
- **Success Criteria**: Each failing test clearly defines expected behavior

### Implementation Progress Tracking
Track progress by monitoring test transition from:
- üî¥ **Red**: "Not implemented yet" errors
- üü° **Yellow**: Implementation started but tests still failing  
- üü¢ **Green**: Tests passing with correct implementation
- üîµ **Refactor**: Code optimized while maintaining green tests

## Architecture Compliance Validation

Each test file validates Clean Architecture compliance by:

1. **Boundary Filters**: Tests ensure repositories implement domain interfaces
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Database concerns separated from domain logic
3. **Result Pattern**: All operations return Result<T> for error handling
4. **Domain Model Integrity**: Entity reconstruction maintains business rules
5. **Transaction Consistency**: Multi-table operations maintain ACID properties

## Database Schema Requirements

### Tables Used by Repositories
- `function_models` - Main model storage
- `function_model_nodes` - Node storage and associations
- `node_links` - Internal node relationships  
- `cross_feature_links` - Cross-feature relationships
- `ai_agents` - Agent registration and management
- `audit_log` - Comprehensive audit trail

### Key Indexes Required
- `function_model_nodes(model_id, node_type)`
- `node_links(source_node_id, target_node_id)`
- `cross_feature_links(source_feature, target_feature)`
- `ai_agents(feature_type, entity_id)`
- `audit_log(table_name, record_id, operation, created_at)`

## Success Metrics

### Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for all repository implementations
- **Architecture Compliance**: All repositories implement domain interfaces
- **Error Handling**: All operations return Result<T> with meaningful errors
- **Performance**: Query operations complete within SLA thresholds
- **Data Integrity**: All multi-table operations maintain consistency

### Completion Criteria
- All 400+ tests passing
- Repository implementations following Clean Architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Performance optimized for production workloads
- Full audit trail and compliance features

## Next Steps

1. **Start TDD Implementation**: Begin with Enhanced SupabaseFunctionModelRepository
2. **Follow Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Write failing tests ‚Üí Make them pass ‚Üí Refactor
3. **Validate Architecture**: Ensure each implementation maintains Clean Architecture
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate repository performance under load
5. **Integration Testing**: Test repository interactions with use cases

---

**Important**: All tests are designed to fail initially. This is intentional TDD behavior. Each failing test serves as a specification for the implementation requirements. Success is measured by systematically turning red tests green while maintaining architectural compliance.
