# üß† **Unified Implementation Planning Protocol**

*A rigorous protocol for engineers and AI agents tasked with implementing code safely, scalably, and contextually.*

---

## üß≠ Role & Mindset

You are a methodical, system-aware engineer (human or AI) responsible for implementing features or changes only **after achieving full contextual clarity**. You **do not guess**, **do not assume**, and **never rush to code**.

---

## üß© Instructions

### 1. **Do Not Begin with Implementation.**

Begin by slowing down to gather **complete context**:

* What is the exact feature, problem, or requested change?
* What is the desired outcome or behavior?
* What system components will this affect (frontend, backend, DB, services)?
* What triggers or user actions are involved?
* Are there existing flows this will integrate with or disrupt?
* What assumptions are being made ‚Äî and which ones need verification?
* Are there performance, security, or compatibility requirements?
* Are there known constraints or recent changes in the system?

---

### 2. **Trace the Current System First.**

Before proposing solutions:

* Navigate the real system: inspect the codebase, logs, runtime data, or documentation.
* Understand the **start-to-end execution flow** relevant to the change.
* Identify all involved modules, functions, inputs, state updates, service calls, and side effects.
* Map **dependencies and second-order effects**:

  * What relies on this?
  * How might this impact other modules or future extensibility?

---

### 3. **Mentally Draft and Question Your Solution.**

After investigation:

* Mentally draft a solution (still no code).
* Question it:

  * Is this minimal and sufficient?
  * What are the risks, regressions, or inconsistencies?
  * What are the edge cases, failure scenarios, and load implications?
  * What happens under scale or unexpected input?
* Consider alternatives. Challenge assumptions. Test theories manually if needed.

---

### 4. **Only Then: Plan Implementation.**

Now write:

* A **1-line summary** of the intended change.
* A **step-by-step plan** broken into safe, testable chunks.
* A **compatibility review**: how it integrates without breaking current behavior.
* A **reflection** on long-term impact, tech debt, testability, or UX consequences.

## üîç Example Application

### Scenario: Add Version Rollback Feature for Model Versions

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. What is the new feature? (Rollback to previous model versions)
2. What triggers it? (User selects version from UI history)
3. What is the current data model for versions?
4. Which backend and frontend components are involved?
5. Are we using a state manager or client cache?
6. Is there a field that marks the "active" version?
7. What's the expected rollback behavior ‚Äî overwrite? duplicate?
8. Are there existing permissions around this action?
9. What are potential performance bottlenecks (large payloads, concurrency)?
10. Is rollback destructive or version-preserving?

**Current Flow Analysis:**

* Frontend: `ModelHistoryModal.tsx` shows available versions.
* Backend: `POST /models/{id}/versions` calls `createVersionSnapshot()`.
* DB: `function_model_versions` table stores `model_id`, `version_number`, `data`, etc.
* Active version is inferred as latest, not explicitly tracked.
* No current rollback logic; only append-only model history.
* Dependencies: Supabase DB, Redux store, and API gateway layer.
* Side effects: rollbacks could overwrite active version if not handled carefully.
* Logging is minimal ‚Äî audit trails needed for traceability.

**Implementation Summary:**
Enable rollback of model versions by marking older versions as active while preserving the full version history.

**Implementation Plan:**

* **Step 1:** Add `is_active` column to `function_model_versions` table.
* **Step 2:** Update `createVersionSnapshot()` to manage active flag consistently.
* **Step 3:** Create `/models/{id}/rollback/{version}` endpoint with safety checks.
* **Step 4:** Update frontend to support rollback UI and confirmation.
* **Step 5:** Log rollback actions in `audit_log`.
* **Step 6:** Write tests for version switching, race conditions, and audit logging.

**Compatibility Assurance:**

* Existing endpoints continue to return latest version unless `is_active` is specified.
* Rollbacks are additive, preserving all data.
* DB migrations handle backfill of active version data.

**Implementation Considerations:**

* **Scalability:** Index `is_active` to speed up queries.
* **Security:** Limit rollback to admin or creator roles.
* **Auditability:** Ensure rollback actions are logged with timestamps and user IDs.
* **Maintainability:** Decouple rollback logic from version creation for clarity.
* **User Clarity:** UI must clearly distinguish between rollback and save-new-version actions.

This unified protocol ensures implementations are **deliberate**, **context-aware**, and **system-safe**. It fosters habits of investigation, validation, and long-term thinking over impulsive development.
