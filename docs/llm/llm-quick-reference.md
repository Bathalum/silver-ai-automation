## üîÑ LLM Feature Documentation Process

### Step 1: Feature Analysis
1. **Identify Feature Scope**: What does this feature do?
2. **Map Components**: List all components involved
3. **Analyze Data Flow**: How does data move through the feature?
4. **Check Architecture**: How does it follow Clean Architecture?
5. **Find Integrations**: How does it connect with other features?

### Step 2: Create Documentation Structure
```bash
mkdir docs/features/[feature-name]
touch docs/features/[feature-name]/overview.md
touch docs/features/[feature-name]/components.md
touch docs/features/[feature-name]/data-flow.md
touch docs/features/[feature-name]/architecture-compliance.md
```

### Step 3: Populate Each Document
1. **Start with overview.md**: Business value, user personas, capabilities
2. **Document components.md**: File structure, hierarchy, data contracts
3. **Map data-flow.md**: State management, API interactions, optimizations
4. **Validate architecture-compliance.md**: Clean Architecture implementation

### Step 4: Update Integration Matrix
1. Add feature to `docs/features/README.md`
2. Update integration matrix with cross-feature relationships
3. Document integration types and data flows

## üéØ Common LLM Tasks

### Creating New Feature Documentation
```markdown
Please create comprehensive documentation for [Feature Name] following our established standards.

Required context:
1. Feature source code: [paste relevant code]
2. Feature purpose: [business value and capabilities]
3. Related features: [list integrations]

Please create all four documents:
- overview.md - High-level feature understanding
- components.md - Detailed component breakdown  
- data-flow.md - Data and state management
- architecture-compliance.md - Clean Architecture alignment

Follow the exact template structure from docs/features/function-model/ and update the integration matrix in docs/features/README.md.
```

### Updating Existing Feature Documentation
```markdown
Please update the documentation for [Feature Name] to match the current implementation.

Required context:
1. Current implementation: [paste updated code]
2. Changes made: [list of changes]
3. Integration updates: [any new integrations]

Please update all four documents to reflect the current state and verify architecture compliance.
```

### Validating Architecture Compliance
```markdown
Please validate the architecture compliance for [Feature Name] against our Clean Architecture principles.

Check:
1. Domain layer independence
2. Application layer orchestration
3. Infrastructure layer adapters
4. Presentation layer minimalism
5. Component hierarchy compliance
6. Data flow patterns

Provide specific recommendations for any compliance issues found.
```

## üö® Common LLM Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Incomplete Documentation
‚ùå **Bad**: Creating only one or two documents
‚úÖ **Good**: Always create all four required documents

### 2. Missing Architecture Compliance
‚ùå **Bad**: Focusing only on components without architecture validation
‚úÖ **Good**: Always validate Clean Architecture implementation

### 3. Incomplete Integration Mapping
‚ùå **Bad**: Documenting features in isolation
‚úÖ **Good**: Always map cross-feature relationships and update integration matrix

### 4. Generic Content
‚ùå **Bad**: Using placeholder content or generic descriptions
‚úÖ **Good**: Provide specific, implementation-based documentation with real code examples

### 5. Missing Updates
‚ùå **Bad**: Creating documentation without updating the integration matrix
‚úÖ **Good**: Always update `docs/features/README.md` with new feature information

## üìö Reference Examples

### Function Model (Complete Example)
- **Location**: `docs/features/function-model/`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Use as**: Primary template for all new features

### Architecture Standards
- **High-Level Context**: `docs/architecture/0_high_level_architecture_context.md`
- **Component Architecture**: `docs/architecture/1_component_architecture.md`
- **Data Flow Patterns**: `docs/architecture/data-flow-patterns.md`

### Integration Matrix
- **Location**: `docs/features/README.md`
- **Purpose**: Cross-feature relationship mapping
- **Update**: Always when adding new features

This quick reference ensures LLMs can efficiently create comprehensive, consistent, and maintainable feature documentation that follows our established architectural principles.
