# LLM Feature Documentation Creation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides LLMs with everything needed to create comprehensive feature documentation following our established standards. Use this guide along with the referenced documents to ensure consistent, high-quality documentation for all features.

## Required Documents for LLM Context

### 1. Core Architecture Standards
- **`docs/architecture/0_high_level_architecture_context.md`** - Foundation for all architectural decisions
- **`docs/architecture/1_component_architecture.md`** - Component design patterns and principles
- **`docs/architecture/data-flow-patterns.md`** - Standard data flow implementations

### 2. Feature Documentation Template
- **`docs/features/function-model/`** - Complete example of the 4-document structure
  - `overview.md` - High-level feature understanding
  - `components.md` - Detailed component breakdown
  - `data-flow.md` - Data and state management
  - `architecture-compliance.md` - Clean Architecture alignment

### 3. Project Context
- **`docs/features/README.md`** - Feature documentation index and integration matrix
- **`docs/README.md`** - Overall documentation structure and navigation

## LLM Feature Documentation Creation Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Feature
Before creating documentation, analyze the feature to understand:

1. **Feature Purpose**: What business value does it provide?
2. **User Personas**: Who are the primary and secondary users?
3. **Key Capabilities**: What are the main functionalities?
4. **Integration Points**: How does it connect with other features?
5. **Technical Implementation**: What components, hooks, and data structures are involved?
6. **Architecture Compliance**: How does it follow Clean Architecture principles?

### Step 2: Create the Four Required Documents

Each feature requires exactly four documents in its directory:

```
docs/features/[feature-name]/
├── overview.md              # High-level feature understanding
├── components.md            # Detailed component breakdown
├── data-flow.md            # Data and state management
└── architecture-compliance.md # Clean Architecture alignment
```

### Step 3: Follow the Complete Template Structure

#### 1. **overview.md** - High-level feature understanding
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Feature - Overview

## Feature Purpose and Business Value
[Core purpose and business value]

## Key Capabilities and Functionality
[Main capabilities and features]

## User Personas and Use Cases
[Primary and secondary personas with use cases]

## Integration Points with Other Features
[How it integrates with other features]

## Success Metrics and KPIs
[Technical, business, UX, and quality metrics]

## Feature Roadmap and Future Enhancements
[Short, medium, and long-term plans]

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
[Performance, security, and integration requirements]
```

#### 2. **components.md** - Detailed component breakdown
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Feature - Components Documentation

## Complete File and Folder Structure
[Complete file tree]

## Component Hierarchy
[Component relationships and hierarchy]

## Component Responsibilities and Relationships
[Detailed component descriptions]

## Component Data Contracts
[TypeScript interfaces and data structures]

## Reusable vs Feature-Specific Components
[Component categorization]

## Component State Management
[State management patterns]

## Component Testing Strategy
[Testing approaches]

## Performance Considerations
[Optimization strategies]
```

#### 3. **data-flow.md** - Data and state management
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Feature - Data Flow Documentation

## Data Flow Overview
[High-level data flow description]

## Data Flow Diagrams
[Visual flow diagrams]

## State Management Patterns
[Application and component state management]

## API Interactions and Data Transformations
[Repository and data transformation patterns]

## Cross-Feature Data Sharing
[Integration with other features]

## Error Handling and Loading States
[Error and loading patterns]

## Data Flow Optimization
[Performance optimization strategies]
```

#### 4. **architecture-compliance.md** - Clean Architecture alignment
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Feature - Architecture Compliance Documentation

## Clean Architecture Implementation
[How the feature implements Clean Architecture]

## Component Architecture Compliance
[Component hierarchy and relationships]

## Testing Strategy Compliance
[Testing approaches]

## Architecture Benefits
[Maintainability, testability, scalability, flexibility]
```

## LLM Documentation Creation Process

### Step 1: Feature Discovery
1. Identify the feature to document
2. Analyze the codebase structure
3. Understand the feature's purpose and scope
4. Map integration points with other features

### Step 2: Create Documentation Structure
1. Create the feature directory: `docs/features/[feature-name]/`
2. Create all four required documents
3. Follow the exact template structure from Function Model example

### Step 3: Populate Each Document
1. **overview.md**: Start with business value and user personas
2. **components.md**: Document all components, their relationships, and data contracts
3. **data-flow.md**: Map data flow, state management, and API interactions
4. **architecture-compliance.md**: Validate Clean Architecture implementation

### Step 4: Update Integration Matrix
1. Update `docs/features/README.md` with new feature information
2. Add feature to the integration matrix
3. Document cross-feature relationships

## Quality Standards

### Completeness
- All four documents must be present for each feature
- Each document must follow the exact template structure
- No missing sections or placeholder content

### Accuracy
- Documentation must match actual implementation
- Code examples must be complete and runnable
- Architecture compliance must be validated

### Consistency
- Follow established patterns and terminology
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Maintain cross-references between documents

### Maintainability
- Regular updates as features evolve
- Version control for documentation changes
- Integration with development workflow

## Integration with Development Workflow

### For New Features
1. Create documentation during feature development
2. Validate architecture compliance
3. Update integration matrix
4. Review with team members

### For Existing Features
1. Review current implementation
2. Identify gaps in documentation
3. Update to match actual implementation
4. Verify architecture compliance

### For Feature Updates
1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Maintain consistency across all four documents
3. Update integration matrix if relationships change
4. Verify architecture compliance

This comprehensive approach ensures that both human developers and AI agents can understand, implement, and maintain features effectively while maintaining architectural consistency across the platform.
