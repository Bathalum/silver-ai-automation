Create comprehensive documentation for [ComponentName] following our established standards.

Required context documents:
- docs/component-documentation-standards.md (complete template)
- docs/components/composite-components/feature-modal.md (perfect example)
- docs/llm-quick-reference.md (More Context)
- docs/llm-documentation-guide.md (LLM-specific instructions)

Component context: Identify the Component Trying to Document and update appropriately
- Component source code: [paste component code]
- Component type: [UI/Composite/Feature]
- Related components: [list related components]

Please follow the complete template structure and use feature-modal.md as your reference example.

Include:
- Complete API documentation with TypeScript interfaces
- Working code examples (Basic, Advanced, Integration)
- Comprehensive testing examples with actual test code
- Performance considerations with specific metrics
- Accessibility documentation with ARIA details
- Proper file location in the correct folder

Ensure all examples are complete, runnable, and follow our component architecture patterns.
