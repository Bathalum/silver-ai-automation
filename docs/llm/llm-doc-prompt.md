Create comprehensive documentation for [Feature Name] following our established standards.

Required context documents:
- docs/features/function-model/ (complete 4-document template example)
- docs/architecture/0_high_level_architecture_context.md (foundation for architectural decisions)
- docs/architecture/1_component_architecture.md (component design patterns)
- docs/features/README.md (feature documentation index and integration matrix)

Feature context: Identify the Feature to Document and update appropriately
- Feature source code: [paste relevant feature code]
- Feature purpose: [business value and capabilities]
- Related features: [list integrations with other features]

Please create all four required documents:
1. **overview.md** - High-level feature understanding (business value, user personas, capabilities)
2. **components.md** - Detailed component breakdown (file structure, hierarchy, data contracts)
3. **data-flow.md** - Data and state management (state patterns, API interactions, optimizations)
4. **architecture-compliance.md** - Clean Architecture alignment (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation layers)

Follow the exact template structure from docs/features/function-model/ and update the integration matrix in docs/features/README.md.

Include:
- Complete business value and user persona analysis
- Comprehensive file/folder structure documentation
- Detailed component hierarchy and data contracts
- Complete data flow mapping with state management patterns
- Architecture compliance validation against Clean Architecture principles
- Cross-feature integration mapping
- Performance and optimization considerations
- Error handling and loading state patterns

Ensure all documentation is specific to the implementation, follows our architectural principles, and maintains consistency with the Function Model example.
