# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Hereâ€™s a tightened-up version of your implementation rule prompt, preserving the **1â€“2 punch** rhythm while making it super clear that **Clean Architecture + TDD are non-negotiable**:

---

# ðŸš¨ IMPLEMENTATION RULE â€” STRICT, NO EXCEPTIONS ðŸš¨

**Principle:**
Always follow **Clean Architecture** and a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** loop. The **code must follow the passing test** â€” never the other way around.

**Scope:**

Applies to all layers:

* **Phase 1:** Domain, Application
* **Phase 2:** UI/API Adapters, Persistence Adapters

**Process (Strict 1â€“2 Punch):**

1. **Test First** â€“ Write the test that defines the behavior.

   * Use `clean-architecture-test-planner` agent.
2. **Implement Code** â€“ Write the minimum Clean Architectureâ€“compliant code that makes the test pass.

   * Use `clean-architecture-implementor` agent.

**Loop:**
Repeat steps **1 â†’ 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 2** until all behaviors are covered and tests pass.

**Non-Negotiable Rule:**

* No skipping.
* No code before a test.
* No test conforming to existing code.
* Every implementation must serve a passing test.

Would you like me to also **reformat this into a Cursor-style rule** (like the one you asked me to make before for implementation planning), so itâ€™s directly enforceable when youâ€™re working inside Cursor?


## Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
# Development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Testing
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage     # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Package Management
This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Always use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`.

## Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture Foundation
This codebase implements **Clean Architecture** with strict layer separation and dependency inversion:

**Layer Structure** (inside-out):
1. **Domain Layer** (`/lib/domain/`) - Enterprise business rules and core entities
2. **Use Cases Layer** (`/lib/use-cases/`) - Application-specific business workflows  
3. **Interface Adapters** (`/lib/infrastructure/`) - Data access and external service implementations
4. **Frameworks & UI** (`/app/`, `/components/`) - Next.js routes and React components

**Critical Rule**: Dependencies only flow inward. Outer layers implement interfaces defined by inner layers.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 14.2** with App Router
- **React 18** with modern hooks patterns
- **TypeScript** for type safety

### UI Components & Styling  
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library built on Radix UI
- **Radix UI** for accessible, unstyled primitives

### Workflow Designer
- **React Flow** (`@xyflow/react`) for the Function Model workflow designer
- **React Flow Legacy** (`reactflow`) for backward compatibility

### State Management
- **React Hooks** for UI state management only
- **Custom hooks** for UI logic coordination
- **URL parameters** for shareable filter states

### Form Handling
- **React Hook Form** with **Zod** validation
- **Form validation separation**: UI validation (format) vs business validation (domain rules)

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase** for authentication and database
- **Server-side rendering** with Next.js API routes

## Project Structure Deep Dive

### Application Routes (`/app/`)
```
(auth)/           # Authentication routes (login, signup, callback)
(private)/        # Protected routes requiring authentication

    function-model/ # Function Model workflow designer
(public)/         # Public routes (landing, about, contact)
api/             # Next.js API routes
```

### Component Architecture (`/components/`)
```
ui/              # Base components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
composites/      # Multi-component compositions
  workflow/      # Workflow-specific composite components
features/        # Landing page feature components
forms/           # Form-specific components
