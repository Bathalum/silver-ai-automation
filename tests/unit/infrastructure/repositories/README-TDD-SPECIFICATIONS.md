# TDD Test Specifications for Aggregate Repository Implementations

## Architectural Compliance Verification

### Clean Architecture Boundaries ✅

**Dependency Direction Enforcement:**
- All repositories extend `BaseRepository` (Infrastructure → Infrastructure)
- All repositories implement domain interfaces (Infrastructure → Domain)
- Tests verify Result pattern usage (Infrastructure → Domain shared)
- No infrastructure leaking into domain (verified through interface compliance)

**Layer Separation:**
- Domain interfaces define contracts (pure domain logic)
- Infrastructure implementations handle persistence concerns
- Tests act as boundary filters preventing architectural violations

### TDD Cycle Compliance ✅

**RED Phase Tests:**
- All tests are written to fail initially (methods don't exist yet)
- Tests define expected behavior before implementation
- Clear assertions on interface compliance and domain mapping

**GREEN Phase Guidance:**
- Tests provide minimal implementation requirements
- Each test focuses on one specific behavior
- Implementation driven by test requirements, not existing code

**REFACTOR Phase Safety:**
- Comprehensive test coverage enables safe refactoring
- Tests verify both functionality and architectural compliance
- Base class integration tested to ensure proper inheritance

### Domain-Driven Design Compliance ✅

**Aggregate Persistence:**
- FunctionModel tests cover complete aggregate with nodes and actions
- NodeLink tests handle cross-aggregate relationships
- AIAgent tests manage agent lifecycle and performance tracking

**Value Object Handling:**
- Tests verify proper NodeId, ModelName, Version object mapping
- Domain entity construction validated through mapping tests
- Type safety enforced through Result pattern usage

**Repository Pattern Implementation:**
- Each repository focused on single aggregate responsibility
- Domain-specific query methods tested (not just CRUD)
- Complex domain operations (publishing, archiving, performance tracking)

### Error Handling and Resilience ✅

**Database Error Translation:**
- Foreign key constraint violations mapped to domain errors
- Duplicate key errors translated to meaningful messages
- Network errors properly wrapped in Result failures

**Domain Validation:**
- Invalid domain data handled gracefully
- Business rule violations captured in tests
- Proper error propagation through Result pattern

**Transaction Safety:**
- Complex operations tested for atomicity
- Bulk operations handle partial failures
- Rollback scenarios covered in error tests

### Performance and Scalability Considerations ✅

**Query Optimization:**
- Index usage verified through mock query assertions
- Bulk operations tested for efficiency
- Pattern matching queries use proper database features

**Caching Integration:**
- Repository pattern enables caching layer addition
- Query patterns designed for cache-friendly operations
- Performance tracking for optimization guidance

**Connection Management:**
- Base repository handles connection lifecycle
- Transaction scope properly managed
- Resource cleanup in error scenarios

### Integration Testing Readiness ✅

**RPC Function Integration:**
- Complex graph analysis operations (cycle detection)
- Semantic search capabilities
- Performance calculation functions

**Database Schema Dependencies:**
- Tests define expected table structures
- Foreign key relationships validated
- Index requirements implied through query patterns

**External Service Integration:**
- AI service configuration persistence
- Notification service integration points
- Cross-feature communication channels

## Implementation Guidance

### Running the Tests
```bash
# Run all repository tests
npm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories

# Run specific repository tests
npm test supabase-function-model-repository.test.ts
npm test supabase-node-link-repository.test.ts  
npm test supabase-ai-agent-repository.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test:coverage tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories
```

### TDD Implementation Steps

1. **Start with RED**: Run tests to see failures (classes don't exist)
2. **Create Minimal Classes**: Extend BaseRepository, implement interfaces
3. **Implement Methods One by One**: Make each test pass individually
4. **Refactor with Confidence**: Use passing tests as safety net
5. **Add Integration**: Test with real Supabase instance

### Key Implementation Notes

**Base Class Integration:**
- All repositories must extend `BaseRepository`
- Use `executeTransaction` for complex operations
- Implement `toDomain` and `fromDomain` abstract methods

**Supabase Specifics:**
- Use `.from()` for table access
- Implement proper error handling for Supabase error codes
- Use `.rpc()` for complex database functions

**Domain Entity Mapping:**
- Handle all value object conversions properly
- Preserve domain entity invariants during mapping
- Use Result pattern for all operations

## Expected Test Results

When implementation is complete, all tests should:
- ✅ **Pass completely** - No failing assertions
- ✅ **Cover all interface methods** - 100% interface compliance
- ✅ **Maintain architectural boundaries** - No Clean Architecture violations
- ✅ **Handle all error scenarios** - Robust error handling
- ✅ **Enable refactoring** - Safe code changes with test coverage

The test specifications serve as both:
1. **Implementation contracts** - Define exact expected behavior
2. **Architectural guardians** - Prevent boundary violations
3. **Documentation** - Executable specifications of repository behavior
4. **Regression protection** - Prevent future breaking changes

These tests are the foundation for TDD implementation of the concrete repository classes that will serve as the persistence layer for the Clean Architecture system.
