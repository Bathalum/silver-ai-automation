# Base Repository Infrastructure Test Specifications

This directory contains comprehensive TDD test specifications for the base repository infrastructure following Clean Architecture principles. These tests serve as **failing specifications** that define the expected behavior contracts for repository implementations.

## üö® TDD Red Phase - Failing Tests Drive Implementation

All test files in this directory are designed to **FAIL initially** as they define behavior that has not yet been implemented. This follows the TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **RED**: Write failing tests that specify desired behavior
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Test Specifications Overview

### 1. BaseSupabaseRepository Test Specification
**File**: `base-supabase-repository.test.ts`

Defines the behavior contract for the generic foundation of all Supabase repositories:

- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforces Clean Architecture boundaries
- **Result Pattern**: All operations return `Result<T>` with no exceptions
- **Entity Mapping**: Clean separation between database rows and domain entities
- **Error Translation**: Database-specific errors translated to domain-friendly messages
- **Query Building**: Safe, parameterized queries without SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Resource management and query optimization
- **Observability**: Logging and metrics for repository operations

### 2. BaseAggregateRepository Test Specification
**File**: `base-aggregate-repository.test.ts`

Defines behavior for repositories managing Domain Aggregate Roots:

- **Aggregate Boundaries**: Complete aggregate loading and persistence
- **Consistency**: Transactional persistence of aggregate + children
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Version-based conflict detection
- **Domain Events**: Event persistence alongside aggregate changes
- **Child Entity Management**: Proper handling of aggregate composition
- **Performance**: Efficient loading with minimal queries (no N+1)
- **Invariant Enforcement**: Business rule validation before persistence

### 3. BaseVersionedRepository Test Specification
**File**: `base-versioned-repository.test.ts`

Defines behavior for repositories managing versioned entities:

- **Semantic Versioning**: Major.minor.patch version management
- **Version History**: Complete audit trail of all versions
- **Publishing Lifecycle**: Draft/published version states
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Safe rollback to previous versions
- **Version Comparison**: Diff calculation between versions
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient version storage strategies
- **Retention Policies**: Automated cleanup of old versions

### 4. BaseAuditableRepository Test Specification
**File**: `base-auditable-repository.test.ts`

Defines behavior for repositories with audit trails and soft deletion:

- **Comprehensive Auditing**: All operations logged with context
- **Soft Deletion**: Reversible deletion with recovery capabilities
- **Data Retention**: Compliance with retention policies
- **User Context**: Full tracking of who, when, where, why
- **Audit Querying**: Rich search and reporting capabilities
- **System Operations**: Distinction between user and system actions
- **Security**: Audit log immutability and integrity

### 5. Result Pattern Compliance Test Specification
**File**: `result-pattern-compliance.test.ts`

Defines error handling behavior across ALL repositories:

- **No Exceptions**: Repository boundaries never throw exceptions
- **Error Translation**: Database errors to domain-friendly messages
- **Consistent Results**: All operations return `Result<T>`
- **Constraint Handling**: Graceful constraint violation management
- **Network Errors**: Connection and timeout error handling
- **Recovery Guidance**: Retry vs permanent error distinction
- **Observability**: Safe error logging without sensitive data

### 6. Transaction Boundary Management Test Specification
**File**: `transaction-boundary-management.test.ts`

Defines transaction management behavior:

- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **Nested Transactions**: Savepoint-based nested transaction support
- **Concurrency Control**: Row and table-level locking
- **Deadlock Resolution**: Detection and automatic resolution
- **Performance**: Resource management and timeout enforcement
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operation handling
- **Error Recovery**: Partial rollback and retry mechanisms

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the test infrastructure set up:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Ensure Vitest is configured
# Check vitest.config.ts in project root
```

### Running Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run specific test specification
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/base-supabase-repository.test.ts

# Run all repository tests
pnpm test tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/
```

### Expected Initial Results

When you first run these tests, you should see:

```
‚ùå FAIL tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/base-supabase-repository.test.ts
‚ùå FAIL tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/base-aggregate-repository.test.ts  
‚ùå FAIL tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/base-versioned-repository.test.ts
‚ùå FAIL tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/base-auditable-repository.test.ts
‚ùå FAIL tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/result-pattern-compliance.test.ts
‚ùå FAIL tests/unit/infrastructure/repositories/transaction-boundary-management.test.ts

Total: 0 passing, 347 failing
```

This is **expected and correct** - these tests define the behavior contracts that must be implemented.

## Implementation Guidance

### Order of Implementation

1. **Start with BaseSupabaseRepository**: Foundation for all other repositories
2. **Implement Result Pattern Compliance**: Error handling across all repositories
3. **Add Transaction Boundary Management**: Core infrastructure for complex operations
4. **Implement BaseAggregateRepository**: DDD aggregate management
5. **Add BaseVersionedRepository**: Version management capabilities
6. **Complete BaseAuditableRepository**: Audit and compliance features

### Implementation Process

For each test specification:

1. **Read the failing test** to understand required behavior
2. **Create minimal implementation** to make the test pass
3. **Verify test passes** and move to next failing test
4. **Refactor** implementation while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** until all tests in specification pass

### Architecture Compliance

All implementations must:

- ‚úÖ Belong to Infrastructure layer
- ‚úÖ Implement interfaces defined in Domain/Application layers
- ‚úÖ Use Result pattern for all operations
- ‚úÖ Translate database errors to domain-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ Never expose database-specific types to calling layers
- ‚úÖ Maintain transactional consistency
- ‚úÖ Provide comprehensive error handling

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Domain Layer**: 90%+ coverage for critical business rules
- **Application Layer**: 85%+ coverage for use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: 80%+ coverage with focus on error paths
- **Overall**: 80%+ code coverage with 100% critical path coverage

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to:

1. **Gate commits**: All tests must pass before merge
2. **Track metrics**: Coverage and quality trends
3. **Performance**: Monitor test execution times
4. **Documentation**: Generate test reports for stakeholders

## Contributing

When adding new repository functionality:

1. **Write failing test first** following TDD principles
2. **Follow existing patterns** in test specifications
3. **Include comprehensive error scenarios**
4. **Test architectural boundary compliance**
5. **Verify Result pattern usage**
6. **Add performance and resource management tests**
