  // 1. Check if the SOP exists
  // 2. Check for dependencies (linked entities)
  // 3. Perform soft delete (mark as archived) or hard delete

  // - Check if SOP is referenced by other entities
  // - Archive instead of hard delete
  // - Update linked entities
  // - Send notifications to relevant users
